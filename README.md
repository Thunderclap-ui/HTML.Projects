<h1> HTML Projects </h1>
<p>This repository is a follow along guide/project showcase of HTML5 which indicates the usage of &lt;tags> and different HTML Elements. This covers basics to advanced HTML concepts through projects, from simple to elegant websites.</p>
<p>HTML elements are building blocks used to structure and define the content of a web page. They are represented by tags and can be used to create headings, paragraphs, links, images, lists, tables, and more. To use an HTML element, you start by opening the tag, which is a less-than sign (<), followed by the name of the element, and then closing the tag with a greater-than sign (>).</p>
