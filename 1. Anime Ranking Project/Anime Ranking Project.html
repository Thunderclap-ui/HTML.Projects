<h1>Best Anime (Jay's Perceptive)</h1>

<h2>My top 5 animes thus far</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>
  My all time favorite is AOT, for it's amazing story content and also the pact
  through which it delivers. I was skeptical at first about Mappa animation, but
  the realism and CGI has made me a MAPPA Simp.
</p>

<h3>Dragon Ball Franchise</h3>
<p>
  This is where my anime journey started like many nime fans did, great story
  arcs, nostalgic scenes. The delivery as well as the fun touch to each episode
  made DB, my all time favorite.
</p>

<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>
  Recent times, I was craving for some magic and amazing story lined anime,
  which i got through BC. Not only was it a great breakthrough with some high
  school like magic genre but also twists and turns to it.
</p>

<h3>My Hero Academia</h3>
<p>
  Who doesn't love a hero genre content, right. <br />
  #Me too<br />
  Awesome narrative and collection of heroes who has amazing touch of powers to
  them, apparently called 'Quirks'.
</p>

<h3>Demon Slayer</h3>
<p>
  I am a huge fan of Feudal Japan and the Edo Era for the advancement of the
  literature and the events occured. Getting a MJ styled super-villain and a
  demon hunting corps who are trained and battle tested to do so. <br />
